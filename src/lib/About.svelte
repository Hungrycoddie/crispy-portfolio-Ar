    Im a passionate student who loves building projects, 
    sharing knowledge and contributing to the Open Source Community. 
    I enjoy the art of learning and then using it in my day to day life.

    My skills are most proficient in Developing  Deploying Apps and Websites 
    with Html 5, css, Javascript, Bootstrap, Flask, and what not?.........to be as a developer,
    but I consider working with these as aside hassel. I am always looking to improve my skills and learn new things.
    And even though I am not very strong at it, I would love to work on ML & AI
    related projects more. But more than that my interests are in building
    something that would benefit everyone equally. and make HUMAN KIND Proud
